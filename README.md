Software engineer and Linux enthusiast. Most of my projects revolve around Game Development(with godot and love2d) and Web Development(with django and node). I also have some projects in c for college.

Studied at ETEC Pirituba, developing IoT projects with ESP32 and Raspberry PI, currently studying computer science in FCT-UNESP with a goal to develop educational games.

Currently learning about functional languages with elixir and phoenix, and using rust for systems programming.

My close-to-completed original projects are pinned.
